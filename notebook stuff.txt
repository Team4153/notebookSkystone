Created a new program 'when things break' to fix the uneven driving issues. 
What we did was have ea. wheel go a set distance (using encoders) at a set speed.
We recorded the time it took to complete for each motor and ran the test 10 times.
We averaged each time and then calculated the ratio of the times relative to ea. other.
(The max number was 1). We are going to use this to scale the motor powers during auto.
TODO: add the coefficients to the hardware
